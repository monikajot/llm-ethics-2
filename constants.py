MFT_EXPLANATION = (
    "Moral foundations theory is social psychological theory that aims to describe moral reasoning. The "
    "theory proposes that morality is 'more than one thing', arguing for the moral foundations: Care, "
    "Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity, Liberty. "
)

CARE = (
    "\nCare: This foundation is related to our long evolution as mammals with attachment systems and an ability to feel "
    "(and dislike) the pain of others. It underlies the virtues of kindness, gentleness, and nurturance. "
)
FAIRNESS = (
    "\nFairness: This foundation is related to the evolutionary process of reciprocal altruism. It underlies the virtues "
    "of justice and rights. "
)

LOYALTY = (
    "\nLoyalty: This foundation is related to our long history as tribal creatures able to form shifting coalitions. "
    "It is active anytime people feel that it’s “one for all and all for one.” It underlies the virtues of patriotism "
    "and self-sacrifice for the group. "
)

AUTHORITY = (
    "\nAuthority: This foundation was shaped by our long primate history of hierarchical social interactions. "
    "It underlies virtues of leadership and followership, including deference to prestigious authority "
    "figures and respect for traditions. "
)

SANCTITY = (
    "\nSanctity: This foundation was shaped by the psychology of disgust and contamination. It underlies notions of "
    "striving to live in an elevated, less carnal, more noble, and more “natural” way (often present in "
    "religious narratives). This foundation underlies the widespread idea that the body is a temple that can be "
    "desecrated by immoral activities and contaminants (an idea not unique to religious traditions). "
    "It underlies the virtues of self-discipline, self-improvement, naturalness, and spirituality. "
)

LIBERTY = (
    "\nLiberty: This foundation is about the feelings of reactance and resentment people feel toward those "
    "who dominate them and restrict their liberty. Its intuitions are often in tension with those of "
    "the authority foundation. The hatred of bullies and dominators motivates people to come together, "
    "in solidarity, to oppose or take down the oppressor. "
